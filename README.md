Wat do? Well, say you run an Exchange organization, but all of your mobile users have iPhones, or Android devices, or really anything not a Windows Phone. No problem, right? 

Bzzt. Wrong!

How do you distribute contacts to your devices? Maybe your carrier has some kind of crappy synchronization app, but what if you could package up the Global Address List (and any Contact objects in Active Directory), and every so often push it to your users? That'd be a timesaver, and everyone would have a full set of contacts all the time.

That's what this script does.
